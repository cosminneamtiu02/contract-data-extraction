# CI/CD Scaffolding — Phase 0.5 Design

**Date:** 2026-05-11
**Branch:** `phase-0.5-ci-cd`
**Worktree:** `.worktrees/phase-0.5-ci-cd/`
**Predecessor:** `phase-0-scaffolding` (historical note: this design doc was written before Phase 0 merged. Phase 0 has since merged via PR #1; the rebase noted in §2 below was performed before PR #2 opened.)
**Scope:** Bring the GitHub-side gates online (CI, CodeQL, Dependabot auto-merge, Dependabot lockfile sync), add the supporting Dependabot config, CODEOWNERS, secret-scanning baseline, editor/git-attribute housekeeping, and expand `.gitignore` + `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. No application code changes. No CLAUDE.md.

## 1. Goal and non-goals

**Goal.** Move the project from "passes `uv run pytest && ruff && mypy` locally" to "every PR is gated by a uniform, parallel CI run; security scanning is on; dependency updates flow through automated lockfile sync and automerge; the production target OS (macOS arm64) has a smoke check; secrets and CVEs are surfaced loudly."

**Non-goals.**
- **No application code** (no `src/extraction_service` changes).
- **No coverage gate in CI** — `pyproject.toml` already pins `fail_under = 80` for local `pytest --cov`, but CI runs `pytest` without `--cov` since Phase 0 only has smoke tests. A later phase re-enables the flag once domain code exists.
- **No CLAUDE.md** — deferred at user's request.
- **No Taskfile** — workflows call `uv run …` directly; one less indirection.
- **No `import-linter`** — architecture enforcement deferred.
- **No `automerge.md` operational document** — rationale lives inline in workflow comments.
- **No paths-ignore on CodeQL** — analyzer scans everything; revisit only if noisy/slow.
- **No `continue-on-error` on pip-audit** — strict CVE gate from day one.

## 2. Branch strategy and worktree lifecycle

The project uses a one-phase-per-worktree convention (see `docs/plan.md` §6.1). This phase is numbered `0.5` because it slots between scaffolding (Phase 0) and domain types (Phase 1) — the locked plan does not enumerate CI as a phase, and adding it to Phase 0 retrospectively would muddy that branch's already-complete history.

Concrete steps already taken:
1. Worktree created via `git worktree add -b phase-0.5-ci-cd .worktrees/phase-0.5-ci-cd master`.
2. This design doc lives at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-ci-cd-scaffolding-design.md` on the new branch, committed before any implementation files.

**Ordering requirement (load-bearing).** `phase-0-scaffolding` MUST merge to `main` before `phase-0.5-ci-cd`'s PR opens. The CI workflow defined here calls `uv run ruff check src tests` and `uv run mypy src tests`; without Phase 0's `src/extraction_service` and `tests/` directories on `main`, CI fails on a fresh PR with "no such directory" before any real check runs. Phase 0's merge gives `main` the source tree; phase-0.5 then rebases on top.

Rebase coupling (known, accepted): when `phase-0-scaffolding` merges to main, `phase-0.5-ci-cd` will have a divergent base. The rebase before its own PR is a single `git rebase origin/main` from inside the worktree — no merge conflicts expected since Phase 0 touches `pyproject.toml` / `src/` / `tests/` / existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and this phase only adds `.github/` + new top-level dotfiles. The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `pyproject.toml` edits are additive (different sections) and unlikely to collide; if they do, resolution is mechanical.

PR opens against main only after the rebase. Per user's PR-based phase integration policy (memory entry `feedback_pr_workflow.md`), no local merge.

## 4. Workflow specifications

### 4.1 `ci.yml` — primary verification gate

**Triggers.** `pull_request: [main]`, `push: [main]`, `workflow_dispatch`. The push-to-main trigger preserves a "main is always known-green" canary run after every squash-merge; concurrency keys the group by `github.ref` plus `github.sha` on pushes so back-to-back squash-merges (during a busy Dependabot day) never cancel each other's post-merge canaries.

**Concurrency.**
```yaml
group: ci-${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.sha || 'pr' }}
cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
```

**Workflow-level permissions.** `contents: read` only. No write surface.

**Job `backend-checks` on `ubuntu-24.04` (timeout: 10 min).** Pin to the major rather than `ubuntu-latest` so GitHub's image rollouts can't silently shift the runner under us; Dependabot's `github-actions` ecosystem will surface the bump as a PR.

Steps, in order:
1. `actions/checkout@<sha>` with `persist-credentials: false` — CI only verifies, never pushes, so we strip the persisted token from `.git/config`.
2. `./.github/actions/read-python-version` — composite action with `id: pyver`; emits `python-version` as a **step output** (see §5 for the API contract; the implementation uses `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` instead of the originally-specified `$GITHUB_ENV` — accepted deviation, see §17.1).
3. `astral-sh/setup-uv@<sha>` with `enable-cache: true`, `cache-dependency-glob: uv.lock`, `github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` (authenticated rate limit), `python-version: ${{ steps.pyver.outputs.python-version }}`.
4. `uv sync --frozen --dev` — installs everything pinned in `uv.lock` plus the `dev` dependency group.
5. **Lockfile freshness:** `uv lock --check` — fails if `pyproject.toml` drifted from `uv.lock`. Symmetric with the `dependabot-lockfile-sync` workflow's role.
6. **Lint:** `uv run ruff check src tests`.
7. **Format check:** `uv run ruff format --check src tests`.
8. **Type check:** `uv run mypy src tests` (strict mode pinned in `pyproject.toml`).
9. **Tests:** `uv run pytest -q`. **No `--cov` flag** — coverage gate deferred until later phases.
10. **CVE scan:** `uv run pip-audit --skip-editable`. Default pip-audit fails CI on any CVE. **Accepted deviation from the original plan's `--strict`** (see §17.2): `--strict` also fails on unauditable packages, which trips on the local editable `extraction-service` package even with `--skip-editable` in some pip-audit versions. The default behavior still surfaces all CVEs; only the unauditable-package edge case is relaxed.
11. **Secret scan:** run `detect-secrets-hook --baseline .secrets.baseline <files>` against `git ls-files` minus the baseline itself. Symmetric with the pre-commit hook so a Dependabot-bypass commit (e.g., the lockfile-sync workflow's automated push) can't sneak a leaked secret onto main. Exact bash form is an implementation detail — anchor regex for the baseline-exclusion is the only subtle part, and `grep -F` is the safe primitive.

**Job `darwin-checks` on `macos-15` (timeout: 10 min).** macOS arm64 is the production target (Mac Mini M4); this job verifies wheel resolution + import succeed there before merge. The example's example-folder darwin job validates a launchd plist via `plutil`; this project has no plist yet, so the smoke-install variant is the right shape.

Steps:
1. `actions/checkout@<sha>` with `persist-credentials: false`.
2. `./.github/actions/read-python-version` (same composite).
3. `astral-sh/setup-uv@<sha>` (same pattern).
4. `uv sync --frozen --dev`.
5. `uv run pytest -q tests/test_smoke.py` — smoke-only. Imports the package, calls the `__main__.main` reference. Catches arm64 wheel resolution failures for `docling`, `rapidocr-onnxruntime`, `modelscope`, and any future native-extension dep before it bites in production.

**Cost note.** macOS minutes are billed at 10× ubuntu. ~30 sec of actual test time per run; the cost driver is `uv sync` resolution (~1–2 min cold, ~20 sec warm via the action's cache). Across ~20 PRs/month this is bounded but real.

### 4.2 `codeql.yml` — static analysis

**Triggers.** `pull_request: [main]`, `push: [main]`, `schedule: [cron: '0 6 * * 1']` (weekly Monday 06:00 UTC).

**Permissions (job-level).**
```yaml
actions: read
contents: read
security-events: write  # SARIF upload
```

**Matrix job `analyze`.**
```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    language: [python, actions]
```

The matrix produces two status checks named `CodeQL / Analyze (python)` and `CodeQL / Analyze (actions)` — exactly the names the user listed.

Steps:
1. `actions/checkout@<sha>` (default config; CodeQL needs full history? — actually `fetch-depth: 0` is required for analysis context; will pin explicitly).
2. `github/codeql-action/init@<sha>` with `languages: ${{ matrix.language }}`. No custom query packs for now; default suite suffices for a fresh codebase.
3. (Skip `autobuild` — neither language requires compile; python is interpreted, actions are YAML.)
4. `github/codeql-action/analyze@<sha>` with `category: "/language:${{ matrix.language }}"`.

**No `paths-ignore`.** Per the user's confirmation, day-one CodeQL scans everything. If signal-to-noise drops, revisit with a paths-ignore for `docs/**` and `tests/**`.

### 4.3 `dependabot-automerge.yml` — squash-merge passing Dependabot PRs

**Triggers.** `pull_request: [opened, synchronize, reopened]` against main. No `workflow_dispatch` — the `user.login` guard is empty on dispatch and the job would silently skip; documenting a dead affordance invites incident-time confusion.

**Concurrency.**
```yaml
group: dependabot-automerge-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
cancel-in-progress: true
```

**Workflow-level permissions.** `contents: read`. Privileged scopes minted only on the job when the guards pass.

**Job `automerge` on `ubuntu-24.04` (timeout: 5 min).**

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
if: github.event.pull_request.user.login == 'dependabot[bot]'
    && github.event.pull_request.draft == false
    && vars.DEPENDABOT_AUTOMERGE_ENABLED == 'true'
```

Single step:
```yaml
- run: gh pr merge --auto --squash "$PR_URL"
  env:
    PR_URL: ${{ github.event.pull_request.html_url }}
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Two guards in series:**
1. Author guard reads `pull_request.user.login` (not `github.actor`) — `user.login` stays `dependabot[bot]` for the PR's lifetime regardless of who triggers individual events. `github.actor` flips to a human if they click "Update branch" in the UI, which would otherwise cause a skip on every human-triggered sync.
2. Kill-switch `vars.DEPENDABOT_AUTOMERGE_ENABLED == 'true'` — flipping this to `"false"` immediately disarms the job (the `permissions:` block isn't even minted, since the `if:` evaluates false), and the job-level scopes vanish on the next event.

**Required setup post-merge.**
1. Branch ruleset on `main` with required status checks: `backend-checks`, `darwin-checks`, `CodeQL / Analyze (python)`, `CodeQL / Analyze (actions)`. Without required checks, `gh pr merge --auto` has nothing to wait for and merges immediately even on red CI — exactly the incident that motivated the example's auto-merge guards.
2. Repo setting: "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" → enabled.
3. Repo variable: `gh variable set DEPENDABOT_AUTOMERGE_ENABLED --body "true"`.
4. Until step 3, the workflow runs but skips on every PR. Safe default.

### 4.4 `dependabot-lockfile-sync.yml` — regenerate `uv.lock` on Dependabot PRs

**Why this exists.** Dependabot's `uv` support has a known parity bug with its pnpm equivalent: when it bumps `pyproject.toml`, it does not regenerate `uv.lock`. `uv sync --dev` papers over the gap at runtime but the committed lockfile drifts. CI's `uv lock --check` step (§4.1.5) would then fail every Dependabot PR. This workflow detects the drift, runs `uv lock`, and pushes the fix back to the PR branch.

**Triggers.** `pull_request: [opened, synchronize, reopened]` against main.

**Concurrency.**
```yaml
group: dependabot-lockfile-sync-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.event.action }}
cancel-in-progress: true
```

The `action` suffix segregates `opened` events from `synchronize` events so an unrelated sync doesn't cancel the regenerator that fired on the initial open.

**Job `sync` on `ubuntu-24.04` (timeout: 10 min).**

Guards: same author + kill-switch shape as automerge, except the var is `DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_SYNC_ENABLED`.

Steps:
1. **Verify PAT.** Read `DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_SYNC_PAT` from env; if empty, emit `::error::` with remediation instructions and exit 1. Without this, a missing PAT silently degrades to "the workflow runs but never pushes."
2. **Checkout PR branch** with `ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}`, `fetch-depth: 50` (enough for typical Dependabot rebase chains; fail-safe checks for missing BASE/HEAD SHAs further down), `token: ${{ secrets.DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_SYNC_PAT }}`.
3. **Composite read-python-version** (same as CI).
4. **Loop guard.** Inspect `git log -1 HEAD`. Skip the rest of the run if last commit author email matches `41898282+github-actions` OR last commit subject matches `chore(deps): regenerate lockfile after dependabot bump`. Two independent guards: the user-id check is the fast path; the commit-subject check is the durable fallback. Either match short-circuits — prevents recursion when our own push fires the next `synchronize` event.
5. **Detect manifest change.** `git diff --name-only $BASE_SHA $HEAD_SHA` looking for `pyproject.toml`. Fail-safe: if either SHA is missing from history (fetch-depth too shallow on a long-history PR), emit `::error::` with a "bump fetch-depth" message rather than silently no-op'ing.
6. **Set up uv** (only if manifest changed; same setup-uv action + version pin as CI).
7. **Regenerate lockfile.** `uv lock` at repo root.
8. **Commit and push.** Stage `uv.lock` only; bail out cleanly if no diff. Otherwise commit with the canonical message (matches the loop-guard subject pattern), push with `--force-with-lease="$HEAD_REF:$HEAD_SHA"` — bounded to the exact head this run started from so a mid-flight `@dependabot rebase` rejects our stale push instead of clobbering the new manifest.
9. **Push-error discrimination.** Capture push stderr. If it matches `non-fast-forward|stale info`, treat as a benign concurrent-push collision (another sync run beat us; the PR head already has the correct lockfile) and exit 0. Any other failure (auth/scope/network) propagates as a real workflow error. Locale-pin via `LANG=C` `LC_ALL=C` so a future runner image with non-English defaults doesn't localize the error and silently break the discriminator.

**PAT setup (one-time, post-merge).** Fine-grained PAT scoped to this repo: `Contents: Read and write` + `Pull requests: Read and write`. Stored as a **Dependabot** secret (not Actions secret) named `DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_SYNC_PAT`:
```bash
gh secret set DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_SYNC_PAT --app dependabot --body "<PAT>"
gh variable set DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_SYNC_ENABLED --body "true"
```
The `--app dependabot` flag is what targets the Dependabot store; Dependabot-triggered workflows can only read secrets from there (2021 supply-chain mitigation).

**Why a PAT (not `GITHUB_TOKEN`).** Pushes authenticated by `GITHUB_TOKEN` deliberately do **not** trigger new workflow runs (anti-recursion protection). Without a PAT, our lockfile-fix push would advance the PR's head but no CI would fire — leaving required status checks attached to the old, broken commit. The ruleset then refuses to merge it. PATs look like normal users and re-trigger CI normally.

## 5. Composite action: `.github/actions/read-python-version/action.yml`

Reads `.python-version` (single-line `3.13`) at repo root and emits `python-version` as a **step output**. Callers give the step an `id` (e.g., `id: pyver`) and reference `${{ steps.pyver.outputs.python-version }}`. Composite-action wrapping keeps the read logic (with `set -euo pipefail` and an explicit empty-string check) in one place; the three callsites (`ci.yml::backend-checks`, `ci.yml::darwin-checks`, `dependabot-lockfile-sync.yml::sync`) each reduce to a single `uses:` line.

> **API change from original plan (§17.1):** the original spec specified `$GITHUB_ENV` (writing `PYTHON_VERSION` as an env var). The implementation uses `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` instead. Step outputs are scoped to the calling job and the step they came from, whereas env vars persist for every subsequent step and could shadow a pre-existing `PYTHON_VERSION`. Accepted as a strict improvement.

`working-directory: .` is required because a calling job may set a job-level `defaults.run.working-directory` to a subdirectory in the future; `.python-version` lives at repo root.

## 6. `.github/dependabot.yml` ecosystems and groups

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: pip
    directory: /
    target-branch: main
    schedule: { interval: weekly }
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    rebase-strategy: auto
    commit-message: { prefix: "chore(deps)", include: scope }
    labels: [dependencies]
    groups:
      fastapi-stack: { patterns: ["fastapi", "starlette", "uvicorn*", "httptools", "uvloop", "watchfiles"] }
      pydantic:      { patterns: ["pydantic", "pydantic-settings"] }
      pytest:        { patterns: ["pytest", "pytest-*"] }
      dev-tools:     { patterns: ["ruff", "mypy", "pip-audit", "types-*", "hatchling", "pyyaml", "detect-secrets"] }
      runtime-singletons: { patterns: ["structlog", "httpx", "ollama", "jsonschema"] }
      ml-stack:      { patterns: ["docling", "rapidocr-onnxruntime", "modelscope"] }

  - package-ecosystem: github-actions
    directory: /
    target-branch: main
    schedule: { interval: weekly }
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    rebase-strategy: auto
    commit-message: { prefix: "chore(deps)", include: scope }
    labels: [dependencies]
    groups:
      github-actions-stack: { patterns: ["actions/*", "astral-sh/*", "github/codeql-action/*"] }

  - package-ecosystem: pre-commit
    directory: /
    target-branch: main
    schedule: { interval: daily }
    open-pull-requests-limit: 1
    rebase-strategy: auto
    commit-message: { prefix: "chore(deps)", include: scope }
    labels: [dependencies]
    groups:
      pre-commit-tools: { patterns: ["*"] }
```

**Group rationale, abridged.**
- `fastapi-stack` — fastapi + starlette + uvicorn share ASGI contract versions; transitives (`httptools`, `uvloop`, `watchfiles`) ride along so a uvicorn bump and its companions land atomically.
- `pydantic` — pydantic + pydantic-settings release in lockstep.
- `pytest` — pytest + plugins ship aligned releases; a mismatched plugin after a pytest bump fails first-CI-run.
- `dev-tools` — ruff / mypy / pip-audit / detect-secrets / `types-*` / hatchling / pyyaml — high churn, cascade-conflict prone on adjacent `pyproject.toml` lines.
- `runtime-singletons` — single-publisher runtime deps with no peer lockstep; grouped to avoid saturating the 5-PR limit during a busy release week.
- `ml-stack` — docling / rapidocr-onnxruntime / modelscope. These have heavy transitive trees and tend to release together; grouping them prevents 3 simultaneous solo PRs each pulling in ~50 transitives.
- `github-actions-stack` — all our action publishers in one group so adjacent-line bumps in one workflow YAML don't cascade-conflict.
- `pre-commit-tools` — daily cadence + group=all + open-PR cap 1 prevents stale + new PRs from doubling up on weekly cadence.

`update-types` filters intentionally omitted from every group so MAJOR bumps stay grouped; a major in one ecosystem without its sibling minor in the same PR re-opens the cascade-conflict surface that grouping closes.

## 7. CODEOWNERS

Single line: `*  @cosminneamtiu02`. Documented as one-line insurance against a future `require_code_owner_review: true` ruleset toggle — without the file, every PR would land in "no required reviewer" limbo if the toggle ever flipped.

## 8. `.gitignore` expansion

Current 19-line file gets these additions:

```gitignore
# Local environment
.env.*
!.env.example

# Tooling caches (additions to existing)
.import_linter_cache/

# OS (additions)
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log

# Claude Code per-machine state (transcripts, worktrees, etc.)
.claude/

# IDE — keep current ignore but allow checked-in shared editor settings
.vscode/*
!.vscode/extensions.json
!.vscode/settings.json
```

`.claude/` is added explicitly. `.idea/`, `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, etc. stay from the existing file.

## 9. `.pre-commit-config.yaml` additions

> **Phase boundary note (§17.3):** the canonical owner of `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is Phase 0.6 (per `docs/plan.md §6.2 task 0.6`). Phase 0.5 deliberately extends that file with the `detect-secrets` and `pre-commit-hooks` blocks below because the symmetric secret-scan gate (local + CI) is part of Phase 0.5's CI/CD scope, not Phase 0.6's local DX scope. The file's full shape after Phase 0.5 is the union of Phase 0.6's initial three local hooks and Phase 0.5's two remote-repo blocks. This is a deliberate, acknowledged overlap, not scope creep.

Existing hooks (local `ruff check` / `ruff format --check` / `mypy`) stay as-is. Append two remote-repo blocks:

```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets
    rev: v1.5.0
    hooks:
      - id: detect-secrets
        args: ['--baseline', '.secrets.baseline']

  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v6.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-json
      - id: check-added-large-files
        args: ["--maxkb=500"]
      - id: detect-private-key
```

`detect-private-key` is a filename+content match, complementary to `detect-secrets` (entropy/regex). Catches an empty `id_rsa` or a partial-paste `.pem` that lacks the standard BEGIN header — exactly the case the entropy scanner misses.

## 10. `pyproject.toml` dev-dependency additions

Append to `[dependency-groups].dev`:
```
"pip-audit>=2.7",
"detect-secrets>=1.5",
```

After the change, `uv lock` regenerates `uv.lock`, and that regenerated file is part of the same commit. CI's lockfile-freshness step then passes.

## 11. `.secrets.baseline` generation

```bash
uv run detect-secrets scan > .secrets.baseline
```
Run once locally after the dev deps are installed. Output is committed. The file is effectively empty for a fresh repo (just plugin metadata); future false positives are silenced via `uv run detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline`.

## 12. `.editorconfig` and `.gitattributes`

Both ported verbatim from the example with the monorepo-specific paths removed:

`.editorconfig`:
```ini
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true

[*.{yml,yaml,json}]
indent_size = 2

[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = false
```

`.gitattributes`:
```gitattributes
* text=auto eol=lf

*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.jpeg binary
*.gif binary
*.ico binary
*.pdf binary
*.onnx binary

uv.lock linguist-generated=true -diff
```

`*.onnx` added because Phase 2 will commit sample model artifacts (per `docs/plan.md` §2.5). The collapse-on-diff for `uv.lock` keeps PR review lightweight.

## 13. Known risks and trade-offs

1. **First CI run may fail on a pinned-dep CVE.** Strict mode is intentional; expect a small bump-up cost on first PR. Two escape hatches if the failing dep can't be bumped immediately: (a) `pip-audit --ignore-vuln <GHSA-id>` in the CI step with a comment explaining the rationale and an expiry-date check, or (b) bump the dep's minimum in `pyproject.toml` to the fixed release. Prefer (b) when feasible; (a) is the bounded-time bridge.

2. **ML wheel resolution on `ubuntu-24.04`.** `modelscope`, `rapidocr-onnxruntime`, and `docling` ship linux-x86_64 wheels but their transitives (e.g., `onnxruntime`) sometimes lag a Python release. `uv.lock` should pin a resolvable set, and if not, that's a real signal — surface it pre-merge.

3. **Coverage gate deferred.** `pyproject.toml` keeps `fail_under = 80`; CI omits `--cov`. A `TODO` should land in a later phase to flip CI's pytest invocation to `pytest --cov`.

4. **Darwin runner cost.** macOS minutes are 10× ubuntu. Smoke test takes ~30 sec; `uv sync` cold ~1–2 min, warm ~20 sec. Budget impact bounded by setup-uv cache hit rate. Acceptable for the production-target-OS confidence.

5. **CodeQL latency.** First analyze on python ~5–10 min cold, ~2–5 min warm. Runs on every PR. Day-one no `paths-ignore` (per user). Revisit if it becomes the long-pole.

6. **Post-merge manual setup required.**
   - Branch ruleset on `main`: require `backend-checks`, `darwin-checks`, `CodeQL / Analyze (python)`, `CodeQL / Analyze (actions)`.
   - Repo setting: "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" → on.
   - `gh variable set DEPENDABOT_AUTOMERGE_ENABLED --body "true"`.
   - Create fine-grained PAT (Contents:RW, Pull requests:RW), then `gh secret set DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_SYNC_PAT --app dependabot --body "<PAT>"` and `gh variable set DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_SYNC_ENABLED --body "true"`.
   - Run `uv run detect-secrets scan > .secrets.baseline` locally once after dev-deps install; commit the baseline.

7. **Phase-0 rebase coupling.** Acknowledged in §2. Touched files don't overlap; rebase should be trivial.

8. **No `automerge.md` operational doc.** Rationale lives inline in the workflow YAML comments. If the workflow set grows enough that the inline rationale becomes unwieldy, a follow-up phase extracts it to `docs/automerge.md`.

## 14. Operator runbook (post-merge)

After phase-0.5 merges to main, run these once:

```bash
# 1. Configure branch protection (assumes ruleset name "main-protection")
gh api -X POST repos/:owner/:repo/rulesets -F name=main-protection -f target=branch \
    --raw-field "conditions[ref_name][include][]=refs/heads/main" \
    -f "rules[][type]=required_status_checks" \
    --raw-field "rules[0][parameters][required_status_checks][][context]=backend-checks" \
    --raw-field "rules[0][parameters][required_status_checks][][context]=darwin-checks" \
    --raw-field "rules[0][parameters][required_status_checks][][context]=CodeQL / Analyze (python)" \
    --raw-field "rules[0][parameters][required_status_checks][][context]=CodeQL / Analyze (actions)" \
    -F "rules[0][parameters][strict_required_status_checks_policy]=true"

# 2. Allow Actions to create/approve PRs
gh api -X PUT repos/:owner/:repo/actions/permissions/workflow -f default_workflow_permissions=read -F can_approve_pull_request_reviews=true

# 3. Arm auto-merge
gh variable set DEPENDABOT_AUTOMERGE_ENABLED --body "true"

# 4. Set up lockfile sync (create PAT in GitHub UI first)
gh secret set DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_SYNC_PAT --app dependabot --body "<paste PAT>"
gh variable set DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_SYNC_ENABLED --body "true"
```

The exact ruleset-creation command may need tweaking after testing; the above is the shape, not gospel. Phase-0.5's exit criteria don't include "ruleset confirmed working" — that's an operator follow-up on main.

## 15. Test plan

Phase 0.5 is config-only — no application code to unit-test. Verification is operational:

1. **Local pre-commit dry run.** `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` — must pass after `.secrets.baseline` is generated.
2. **CI first-run on PR.** Push the branch, open PR against main. All five required checks (`backend-checks`, `darwin-checks`, `CodeQL / Analyze (python)`, `CodeQL / Analyze (actions)`) must run and report — the only acceptable failure mode is a real CVE flag (§13.1) or a real CodeQL finding, which would then be a Phase-0.5.1 follow-up.
3. **Auto-merge dry-run with a dummy PR.** After merge + post-merge setup (§14), wait for the first Dependabot PR and verify the auto-merge fires once all required checks go green. Until then, the workflows no-op.
4. **Lockfile sync dry-run.** Manually edit a dep in `pyproject.toml` on a branch, open PR, push, observe the regenerator commit landing on the branch.

## 16. Out of scope (explicit deferrals to future phases)

- Coverage gate in CI (re-enable `--cov` once domain code lands).
- `import-linter` architecture contracts (depends on domain layout, lands with Phase 1 or Phase 2).
- `automerge.md` operational doc (only if inline rationale becomes unwieldy).
- ~~`CLAUDE.md` (user-deferred; revisit when collaboration patterns crystallize).~~ **Resolved** in §17.6.
- E2E test job in CI (the locked plan §6.8 marks E2E as manual-only; honor that).
- `TEMPLATE_FRICTION.md`-style upstream-bug tracker (no template forks here).

## 17. Accepted deviations recorded post-implementation

These were identified by a 20-agent panel code review after Phase 0.5 merged. They are deliberate departures from this spec, accepted rather than reverted.

### 17.1. Composite action API: `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` instead of `$GITHUB_ENV`

The spec (§5) specified writing `PYTHON_VERSION` to `$GITHUB_ENV`. The implementation emits a step output `python-version` via `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`. Step outputs are scoped to the emitting step and the job that consumes them; env vars persist for every subsequent step and could shadow a pre-existing `PYTHON_VERSION`. The implementation is a strict improvement; the spec text in §4.1 and §5 has been updated to match.

### 17.2. CI pip-audit: `--skip-editable` instead of `--strict`

The spec (§4.1 step 10) specified `--strict`. The implementation uses `--skip-editable` without `--strict`. `--strict` also fails on unauditable packages; the local editable `extraction-service` package is unauditable by definition. Testing confirms `--strict --skip-editable` still fails on the editable package in current pip-audit versions. The default pip-audit behavior still surfaces all CVEs against pinned deps — only the unauditable-package edge case is relaxed. The strict CVE gate the spec required is preserved in substance.

### 17.3. Phase 0.5 extending Phase 0.6's `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

The locked plan (`docs/plan.md §6.2 task 0.6`) designates `.pre-commit-config.yaml` as Phase 0.6's artifact. Phase 0.5 additionally added the `detect-secrets` and `pre-commit-hooks` blocks (see §9) to provide symmetric local-and-CI secret-scan coverage. The overlap is deliberate: secret-scan tooling spans both phases' scopes (local DX + CI gates). Future readers tracing the file's history will see contributions from both phases — this note makes the boundary explicit.

### 17.4. Post-review hardening (separate branch)

The same panel review surfaced several additional issues that landed on the `chore/panel-review-fixes` branch as a follow-up:

- CodeQL action pinned to commit SHA (was mutable `@v4` tag)
- CodeQL `concurrency:` group disambiguated for `schedule` events
- Dependabot pip groups gated with `update-types: [patch, minor]` so major bumps require explicit human review (auto-merge guard)
- `dependabot-lockfile-sync.yml` commit step `if:` tightened to require `needs_uv == 'true'`
- `[tool.uv] dev-dependencies = []` removed (deprecated, produced warnings on every `uv` invocation)
- `ruff>=0.9` (was `>=0.7`; 0.9+ has complete Python 3.13 grammar coverage)
- ruff `C4` + `FURB` rule families added
- mypy `warn_unreachable = true` added
- `pyyaml` reclassified from `dev-tools` to `runtime-singletons` Dependabot group (it is a runtime dep)
- `__all__` declared in `src/extraction_service/__init__.py`; package docstring added
- `src/extraction_service/py.typed` marker added (PEP 561)
- `__main__.py` carries an anchor TODO referencing Phase 5 wiring
- `.gitattributes` `uv.lock merge=union` reduces lockfile conflict noise
- `check-toml` pre-commit hook added
- MIT `LICENSE` added; declared in pyproject `license` + `license-files`

### 17.5. Pass-2 panel re-run on post-#3 main (`chore/panel-review-fixes-pass-2`)

A second pass of the 20-agent panel against `main` after PR #3 merged surfaced one substantive convergent finding and several doc/code cleanups. Items landed on the `chore/panel-review-fixes-pass-2` branch:

- **Dependabot `update-types` consistency.** PR #3 applied `update-types: [patch, minor]` only to pip groups. Pass-2 lenses 01, 10, 12, 20 independently flagged that `github-actions-stack` and `pre-commit-tools` groups were left exposed to the same major-bump auto-merge gap. Filter now applied to all three ecosystems.
- **`hypothesis` Dependabot grouping.** Was ungrouped (no `update-types` guard at all); now in the `pytest` group.
- **Spec/plan doc accuracy.** Stale `$GITHUB_ENV` references in spec §3 inventory comment, plan Task 6.2 code block, plan Task 8.1/8.2/11.1 call-sites, and the plan file-structure header — all updated to match the actual `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` implementation. `docs/plan.md §5.1` pyproject sample updated to include `license` / `license-files`, `warn_unreachable`, `pip-audit`, `detect-secrets`, and the `PT` ruff family.
- **§4.4 typo.** Loop-guard description said `"chore(deps): regenerate lockfiles after dependabot bump"` (plural); implementation uses singular `lockfile`. Spec aligned to singular.
- **`__all__: list[str] = []` removed from `__init__.py`.** PR #3 added it on Pass-1 Lens 06's recommendation; Pass-2 Lens 07 flagged it as premature — an empty `__all__` silently masks symbols added later unless someone updates the list. Docstring now documents the deliberate omission until real public exports exist.
- **`PT` (flake8-pytest-style) ruff rule family added.** Cheap to add against the current 2-test suite; would have produced a noisy retroactive diff once tests grow.
- **`test_smoke.py` tautology comments.** Module docstring now records that the assertions are intentionally tautological at this phase, preventing re-litigation on future review cycles.
- **`permissions: {}` on `dependabot-lockfile-sync.yml` sync job.** Defense-in-depth: this job authenticates pushes via the PAT, not GITHUB_TOKEN; the explicit empty block makes that intent explicit and prevents inheritance by future steps.

### 17.6. `CLAUDE.md` — operating manual for Claude Code

The original `§16` deferral ("CLAUDE.md — user-deferred; revisit when collaboration patterns crystallize") is now resolved. After two panel-review rounds (PRs #3 and #4), the project has a stable, opinionated code-review methodology — the 20-lens parallel panel — plus a set of triage rules and verification conventions that future sessions (and future contributors) should not have to re-derive. [`CLAUDE.md`](../../../CLAUDE.md) at repo root codifies:

- Project context (one paragraph, pointers to deeper docs)
- The 20-lens panel: roster, dispatch mechanics, per-lens prompt template, multi-pass review framing
- Synthesizer rules: demote-aggressively, promote-convergence, inter-lens-disagreement-resolution, reverse-prior-fixes-when-justified
- Triage rules: **cosmetic-always-applies**, narrow defer bucket (only "needs later-phase code to exist" qualifies), explicit skip cases
- Implementation flow: branch-from-main → fix → verify → conventional-commit groups → PR → no local merge
- Verification gate: exact local commands that must pass before commit, including wheel-build inspection when package metadata changes
- Project-state guardrails: README is user-restricted, deviation log goes in spec §17, default branch is `main`
- When NOT to use the panel (trivial PRs → single-agent review; cloud-billed deep reviews → `/ultrareview`)

`CLAUDE.md` is loaded automatically by Claude Code at session start. Other AI assistants with similar conventions (`AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`) can read the same file; this project does not maintain separate copies.

### 17.7. IDE warning silenced via placeholder Actions-store secret

The VSCode GitHub Actions extension (`github.vscode-github-actions`) raises a permanent "Context access might be invalid: DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_SYNC_PAT" diagnostic on both references in [`.github/workflows/dependabot-lockfile-sync.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/dependabot-lockfile-sync.yml) (lines 60, 76). The diagnostic is correct in the narrow sense that the secret is not in the **Actions** secret store — it lives in the **Dependabot** secret store, which is the only store visible to `pull_request` workflows triggered by `dependabot[bot]`. The extension does not query the Dependabot store and offers no inline-suppression mechanism (upstream: [github/vscode-github-actions#108](https://github.com/github/vscode-github-actions/issues/108) and duplicates).

Accepted workaround: seed a same-named placeholder secret in the Actions store. The placeholder value is non-functional (any push attempting to use it would fail authentication loudly — an intentional failure mode that would surface store-routing bugs immediately rather than masking them). At runtime the workflow continues to read the real PAT from the Dependabot store; the Actions-store value is never read.

- Operational step (one-time): `gh secret set DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_SYNC_PAT --body "<placeholder>"` (Actions store, no `--app dependabot` flag).
- Workflow header documents the duplication so a future maintainer doesn't mistake the Actions-store entry for a live secret or remove it as redundant.
- Rotation discipline: when the real Dependabot-store PAT is rotated, the Actions-store placeholder does NOT need rotation — it carries no live credential value.

### 17.8. Phase 1 panel re-run (post-PR-#8-merge into `phase-1-domain`)

Recorded after the 20-lens panel was re-run against `phase-1-domain` at the post-#8-merge state (range `0bed324..70527da`) on 2026-05-12. This pass produced the following changes against `phase-1-domain` itself (not a separate `chore/panel-review-fixes-*` branch — per the strengthened cosmetic-always rule, all in-scope fixes land on the active phase branch when the panel is run as a phase-PR self-review).

**Plan / spec deviations introduced or acknowledged in this pass:**

- **Exception class names gain the `Error` suffix.** Plan §4.13's original class names — `OcrEmptyOutput`, `ContextOverflow`, `SchemaInvalid` — drop the `Error` suffix. The Phase 1 re-run's Lens 08 (Idiomatic Python + ruff `N`) flagged this as a PEP 8 / N818 violation. User decision: rename to `OcrEmptyOutputError`, `ContextOverflowError`, `SchemaInvalidError` rather than `extend-ignore = ["N818"]`. The plan text in §4.13 has been updated in-place to match the renamed classes; the §6.5 / §6.6 task-table prose references the new names too. This is a *retroactive plan-doc update*, not a deviation log of code-vs-plan drift.

- **`StageRecord.extracted: dict[str, Any] | None` field added in Phase 1.** Plan §6.3 task 1.3's spec for `StageRecord` enumerates `state, started_at, completed_at, duration_ms, error` — no `extracted`. Lens 01 (plan adherence) flagged that the field belongs to Phase 4 task 4.5's worker output and was added early. Rationale for landing it in Phase 1: plan §3.2 explicitly says "Orchestrator reads `data_parsing.extracted` when `overall_status == 'done'`" — the slot is a plan-architecture commitment regardless of which phase populates it. Adding the field as `dict[str, Any] | None = None` costs nothing today and avoids a breaking schema change when Phase 4 worker code lands. Field is typed at the IO boundary per CLAUDE.md project-wide best practice.

- **`RetryOnCode` Literal duplicates `ExtractionError.code` values intentionally.** `extraction_service.config.run_config.py` declares a `Literal["ocr_engine_failed", "ocr_empty_output", "llm_failed", "context_overflow", "schema_invalid"]` mirroring the concrete `ExtractionError.code` class attributes. Two design intents: (a) avoid a `config → domain` import dependency that would couple business config to domain code; (b) surface YAML-side typos at boot via Pydantic. A consistency test (`test_retry_on_code_literal_mirrors_concrete_extraction_error_codes`) walks `ExtractionError.__subclasses__()` and asserts no drift. The base-class sentinel `"extraction_error"` is intentionally excluded from the Literal — it is never a concrete retry trigger.

- **`RetryConfig.retry_on` rejects OCR codes via `@field_validator`.** Per plan §3.3 OCR errors are deterministic on the input and never retried. The Literal *includes* the two OCR codes for type-completeness (a consumer might want to log them); the validator is the semantic guard ensuring `retry_on: [ocr_engine_failed]` raises `ValidationError` at boot.

- **`StageRecord.fail(error, now=None)` → `fail(now=None, *, error)` for signature symmetry with `complete()`.** Lens 06 (Naming & API surface) flagged that `fail()`'s positional-`error`-first signature differed from `complete(now=None, *, extracted=None)`. The new symmetric signature prevents Phase 4 worker call sites from accidentally transposing `now` and `error` when the three transition methods appear close together.

- **`tests/fakes/` and `config/` example directories absent.** Plan §5's project-layout diagram lists `tests/fakes/{fake_ocr.py, fake_ollama.py}` and `config/{run_config.example.yaml, domain_model.example.json, extraction_prompt.example.txt}`. Both are assigned to later phases (fakes to Phase 2.2 + Phase 3.x; example configs to Phase 6.6). Phase 1 ships without scaffolding placeholders — the "no premature abstraction" rule outweighs filetree-diagram precision.

**Methodology / `CLAUDE.md` additions in this pass:**

- "Phase development methodology — go-to strategy (Superpowers flow)" section added (worktree + parallel subagent dispatch + automatic 20-lens self-review + PR-as-handoff).
- "Apply-first-then-report execution order" subsection added to the synthesizer rules: section 2 (Objective) and section 3 (Headbutting) auto-apply *before* the report is shown to the user, so the report is a confirmation log with commit SHAs rather than a planning document asking permission.
- Synthesis report restructured into 6 strict-order sections (Verdicts → Objective → Headbutting → 4a Deferred-later-phase → 4b Deferred-other → User decision).
- Cosmetic-fixes-always-apply rule strengthened: explicitly enumerates the kinds of items that count and adds "cosmetic items NEVER appear in Deferred" as a hard rule.
- Ruff `select` extended with `EM`, `TRY`, `TCH`, `N`, `S` rule families. Test per-file-ignores: `ARG`, `EM101`, `TRY003`, `S101`, `S108`.
- `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` gains `markers = []` (pre-empt `--strict-markers` footgun) and `filterwarnings = ["error::DeprecationWarning"]` (forward-looking DeprecationWarning gate).
- `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` gains `exclude = ["**/__pycache__"]`.
- `tests/conftest.py` added (autouse `_reset_structlog_state` fixture, promoted `isolated_env` from test_settings.py).

**State changes captured here for memory parity:**

- Lockfile-sync workflow state was previously described as "configured but currently disarmed pending PAT setup" in CLAUDE.md. As of 2026-05-12 it is live and armed (PAT set in Dependabot store; `vars.DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_SYNC_ENABLED = "true"`).
